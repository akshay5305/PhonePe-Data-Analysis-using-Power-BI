Project Overview:
In this project, I developed an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard to analyze PhonePe transaction data across different states and service categories. The goal was to uncover user behavior patterns, transaction volume trends, and region-wise service performance in India.

üîç Key Features:
State-wise and City-wise Transaction Analysis
Visualized total transaction value and volume across Indian states, with heatmaps and ranking charts.

Service Category Trends
Compared usage across various services like recharges, bill payments, P2P transfers, and more.

Time-Based Insights
Integrated time-series charts to track trends over different periods and seasonal behavior.

Interactive Slicers and Filters
Enabled users to dynamically explore data by time, region, and service type.

KPIs and DAX Measures
Built custom KPIs using DAX to measure average transaction values, YoY growth, and high-activity zones.
